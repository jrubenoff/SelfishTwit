### Do you find yourself only reading Twitter for the links?

Well, you're in luck. SelfishTwit lets you bypass all of that pesky humanity to get to that sweet, sweet #content.

### What is it?

SelfishTwit is a userstyle for Twitter's timeline and list pages. **It only shows you links.** You can't tweet or read your @replies. There are no Twitter Cards, favorite buttons or follower counts.


Any tweets which don't contain links are automatically hidden. While Twitter.com truncates external links within your timeline, SelfishTwit shows you the full URL. Hovering over a link in SelfishTwit shows you the full tweet for additional context, which helps when looking at shortened URLs.


### How do I get started?

You can add SelfishTwit as a userstyle Stylish for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe), [Safari](http://sobolev.us/stylish/), or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/).

Cut and paste `selfishtwit.css` into the Stylish settings to get started. Make sure to restrict the domain to `twitter.com`.

Personally, I like to use SelfishTwit inside a [Fluid](http://fluidapp.com/) instance. This lets me add handy links to all of my lists to the bookmarks bar, while letting me view Twitter normally in other browsers.

### I'm only seeing five or ten links, and Twitter isn't loading more. What do I do?

In many cases, SelfishTwit hides multiple pages worth of linkless tweets from your timeline. Twitter's timeline seems to only load new tweets once you scroll down. But when SelfishTwit is on, there might be no room to scroll.

There's an easy fix for this: make your window comically short, so that there's room for you to scroll down.

When new links have loaded, you can restore the window to its normal size.
