### SelfishTwit
#### A Twitter userstyle for antisocial news junkies

Do you find yourself only reading Twitter for the links?

SelfishTwit is a userstyle for Twitter's timeline and list pages. **It only shows you links.** You cannot tweet or read your @replies. There are no Twitter Cards, favorite buttons or follower counts. Any tweets which don't contain links are automatically hidden. SelfishTwit lets you bypass all of that pesky human sentiment to get to those sweet, sweet #thinkpieces and #content.

While Twitter.com truncates external links within your timeline, SelfishTwit shows you the full URL. This helps you bypass links from sites you don't care to visit. Many CMSes also include their blog post's full title in a URL slug, so SelfishTwit also sort of works as a garbled headline scanner.

Hovering over a link in SelfishTwit shows you the full tweet, for additional context.

### Getting started

You can use SelfishTwit in conjunction with Stylish for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe), [Safari](http://sobolev.us/stylish/), and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/).

Cut and paste `selfishtwit.css` into the Stylish settings to get started. Make sure to restrict the domain to `twitter.com`.

Personally, I like to use SelfishTwit inside a [Fluid](http://fluidapp.com/) instance. This lets me add handy links to all of my lists to the bookmarks bar, while letting me view Twitter normally in other browsers.

### I'm only seeing five or ten links, and Twitter isn't loading more. What do I do?

In many cases, SelfishTwit hides multiple pages worth of linkless tweets from your timeline. Twitter's timeline seems to only load new tweets once you scroll down. But when SelfishTwit is on, there might be no room to scroll.

There's an easy fix for this: make your window comically short, so that there's room for you to scroll down.

When new links have loaded, you can restore the window to its normal size.
